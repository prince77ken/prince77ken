## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A Software Engineer who specializes in using software engineering tools to help organizations change the world.

I've spent the last few years working on a number of amazing projects: landing pages, a browser extension, school management software, community websites, and an online conference app for event planners. I'm in the top 0.8% of active GitHub users in my country, which is a small brag but something I'm really proud of.

I've developed extensive knowledge in: Front-End: JavaScript | React | HTMLS | CSS3 | SASS | Tools & Methods: Gift | Github | Netlify | Vercel | Mobile/Responsive Development | Chrome Dev Tools. 

Passionate about ideating, conceptualizing, and producing consumer-centric technology and technology-enabled products from level zero. Open for exploring exciting full-stack development opportunities in startups as well as companies with scale.
